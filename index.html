   <h1>Welcome to the Glenwood Shool District</h1>
   <h2>Proud Past, Concerning Present, Shrinking Future</h2>
   <p>Here at Glenwood Shools we care about our students, that's why more land is dedicated to sports complexes then schools! Another way we make sure are students have the best learning environment is by enforcing a strict email response policy on staff so that students are always able to get help and be in-the-know about whats going on!</p>
